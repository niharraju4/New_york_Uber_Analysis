# New_york_Uber_Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive data analysis on Uber ride data in New York City, focusing on preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and geospatial visualization.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
plotly
folium
You can install these packages using pip:
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly folium

# Instructions for Use
Clone or Download the Repository
Ensure the script file (uber_newyork_dataanalysis.py) and the dataset files are in the same directory.

# Load and Preprocess Data
The script reads the dataset from the specified path. Ensure the paths in the os.listdir and pd.read_csv functions point to the correct locations of your dataset files.

# Execute the Script
Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a local Python IDE).

# Visualization and Analysis
The script includes various visualization commands. Ensure you have an appropriate environment to render these visualizations (e.g., Jupyter Notebook for inline plotting).

Adjustments and Customization
Modify the paths and DataFrame column names as needed to match your dataset.
Customize the analysis by changing the parameters in the utility functions or by adding new analysis blocks.

Troubleshooting
Ensure all necessary packages are installed and properly imported.
Verify the paths to your dataset files and adjust them if necessary.
If encountering any issues with specific packages or functions, consult the respective package documentation for more details.

# Key Functionalities

Libraries Import
Import essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and geospatial analysis.

Loading Data
Load Uber ride data from CSV files into pandas DataFrames.

Data Preprocessing
Check for and handle duplicate rows.
Convert date columns to appropriate datetime format.
Extract and create new columns for month, day, hour, and weekday from the datetime column.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the distribution of rides by month and day of the week.
Create crosstabs to explore relationships between different time-based features.
Plot various graphs including bar plots, line plots, box plots, and violin plots using seaborn and plotly.

Geospatial Analysis
Use folium to create a heatmap showing the density of Uber rides across different locations in New York City.

Data Concatenation
Concatenate multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame for comprehensive analysis.

Utility Functions
Define utility functions to generate pivot tables for pairwise analysis of different features.
